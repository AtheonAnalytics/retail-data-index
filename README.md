# Retail Data Index
Retail Data Index is a free and collaborative resource for gathering and disseminating information about retail data sources globally. It is envisioned to be a key resource for the builders of Demand Signal Repositories and retail data analysts who seek to understand the demand for their products by assembling sales and supply chain data for analysis.

Given the lack of standards and wide variability of provision of this data it is challenging to discover, create and maintain a global library of demand sensing pipelines. 
This project aims to provide a platform to share knowledge across the retail and consumer goods industry and ultimately provide a comprehensive index of all retailer generated demand signals.
